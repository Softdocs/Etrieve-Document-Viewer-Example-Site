                Here we have a few fields we use to provide some simple search capabilities.
                There are change events that trigger functions in our view model.
                Query and Fields are both tied into the same search functionality, so their change events trigger the same function.
                The Document ID input is tied to search specifically by a document id, and therefore has it's own trigger function.

                The 'bind' and 'trigger' syntax are Aurelia's binding language, and provides a means to which to bind values between view and view model,
                    as well as trigger specific functions based off change events (https://aurelia.io/docs/binding/basics)
